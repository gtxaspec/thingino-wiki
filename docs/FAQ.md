### What is the default login?

The default login is _root_ with the password _root_. 

The default streaming user is _thingino_ with the password _thingino_. This can be changed via web interface.


### How to reset the root password?

Turn off the camera's power. Press and hold the reset button, then turn the power back on. Keep holding the button for 5 seconds during boot. This should reset the camera to its default settings with _root_ as a password. **Your camera needs to have the `gpio_button` pin set!**


### How do I change the MAC address on an interface?

Change it in bootloader environment with `fw_setenv` command. Use `ethaddr` parameter for ethernet interface, `wlanmac` for wireless interface.

```
fw_setenv ethaddr 12:34:56:78:AB:CD
fw_setenv wlanmac 12:34:56:78:AB:EF
```
This method to set the MAC should survive future firmware updates done using the `sysupgrade -p` method.   

Separately, if you were worried about the MAC address change, the new MAC address that Thingino uses is generated based on the serial # of the camera's CPU, so it should never change after the initial install process.


### How to update only bootloader?

**From the PC:** Download a full image for your camera from [thignino releases page](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/releases/tag/firmware) on GitHub. Extract first 256KB of bootloader partition into a separate file. Upload that file to the camera and flash it into the bootloader partition:

```
wget https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/releases/download/firmware/thingino-teacup.bin
dd if=thingino-teacup.bin bs=256K count=1 of=bootloader.bin
scp -O bootloader.bin root@192.168.1.10:/tmp/
ssh root@192.168.1.10 flashcp -v /tmp/bootloader.bin /dev/mtd0
````

Alternatively, you can do that directly on the camera:
```
cd /tmp
curl -LJO https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/releases/download/firmware/thingino-teacup.bin
truncate -s 256K thingino-teacup.bin
flashcp ./thingino-teacup.bin /dev/mtd0
```


### Do you have a mobile app to view/control the camera?

We recommend to use [tinyCam Monitor Pro](https://tinycammonitor.com/).

### Can Thingino run on this unsupported camera?

If the camera in question has an Ingenic SoC, there is a good chance that Thingino can run on it.
You can try to convert it using one of the prebuilt module firmware files or build a new one yourself.
Donate such a camera to the project to speed up the process!  

Visit the [[Porting Guide|Porting-Guide]] on information on porting a new device.

See our complete table of [[Supported Hardware|Tech-Info-‚Äê-Supported-Hardware]].


### Is my data safe? Do you collect data, metrics or telemetry?

Thingino does not collect any data, metrics, or telemetry, ensuring your data remains solely on your device and entirely under your control. Being fully open source, Thingino allows you to audit the code and verify its operations, providing full transparency and peace of mind.

### How to revert camera back to stock firmware?

Place the original stock firmware backup file on an SD card and name as autoupdate-full.bin. Insert the card with the file into the camera and reboot.

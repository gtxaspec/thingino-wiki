## Community

We are open and friendly, but not woke, tolerant, or inclusive. Do not expect a special attitude _just because_. Respect must be earned and is never guaranteed.

Do not just come to the open table and ask for goods. Bring something and share.

We have many resources and a long history of discussion. Use the knowledge base, read the wiki, use search before you ask questions.

Spread the word.

Help newcomers.

Less is more. Try to get the best result with the least amount of code and the simplest tools.

Any camera-specific configuration and customization should be done outside the camera, if possible.

Bad code is better than no code at all. But good code is better than bad code.

Scripts, comments, documentation, and examples should go to off-camera resources: project website, project wiki, etc.
Remember that we only have so much space in embedded.

Good readable code with little or no comments is better than bad obfuscated code with comments.

Debug messages must contain details: what happened, where it happened, what data came in, what data came out, etc. 
_"Shit happened!!!!"_ is not a good debug message.
While _"Shit happened while running make_it_good(a) with a=123. Got 567 when 987 was expected."_ is.

We are hobbyists and we do things the way we know how. If you know better, come and teach us.

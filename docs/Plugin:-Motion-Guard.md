Thingino utilizes motion detection capabilities of the Ingenic ISP.

A motion event is detected by the streamer which triggers the `/sbin/motion` script, which in its turn sends alerts through the selected and preconfigured notification methods. You must configure at least one notification method for the motion monitor to work.

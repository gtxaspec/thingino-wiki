### Introduction

Thingino is an open source firmware for IP cameras built on an Ingenic SoC.
This independent project has a vision and approach that embraces the open source ideals.  

Thingino does not try to build a universal firmware file that would be used on multiple camera models.
Instead, we build a firmware which is nicely tailored to the targeted hardware, with minimum overhead.

Thingino is young but develops fast. You should expect frequent updates, exciting new features, and occasional breaking changes.

Thingino uses a custom version of [prudynt][1] as a go-to streamer while working on its own fully open modular solution - [Raptor][2].

For more details on our project philosophy, please see the [Project Philosophy](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/wiki/Project-Philosophy) page.

Please join our [Telegram channel][3] and [Discord server][4] for realtime conversation with developers and users of the firmware.
